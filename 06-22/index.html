    <div class="content">"THIS IS MY WEBPAGE, THERE ARE MANY LIKE IT BUT THIS ONE IS MINE. MY WEBPAGE IS MY BEST FRIEND. IT IS MY LIFE. I MUST
      MASTER IT AS I MASTER MY LIFE. WITHOUT ME IT IS USELESS, WITHOUT MY WEBPAGE I AM USELESS. I WILL BUILD MY WEBPAGE TRUE,
      I MUST SHOOT STRAIGHTER THAN MY ENEMY WHO IS TRYING TO KILL ME, I MUST SHOOT HIM BEFORE HE SHOOTS ME….I WILL. MY RIFLE
      AND MYSELF KNOW WHAT COUNTS IN WAR IS NOT THE ROUNDS WE FIRE, THE NOISE OF OUR BURST, NOR THE SMOKE WE MAKE. WE KNOW
      THAT IT IS HITS THAT COUNT. WE WILL HIT…s MY RIFLE IS HUMAN, EVEN AS I, BECAUSE IT IS MY LIFE. THUS I WILL LEARN IT
      AS A BROTHER, LEARN ITS WEAKNESSES, ITS STRENGTHS, ITS PARTS, ITS ACCESSORIES, ITS SIGHTS AND ITS BARREL. I WILL EVER
      GUARD IT AGAINST THE RAVEGES OF WEATHER AND DAMAGE. I WILL KEEP MY RIFLE CLEAN AND READY, EVEN AS I AM CLEAN AND READY.
      WE WILL BECOME PART OF EACH OTHER. WE WILL… BEFORE GOD I SWEAR THIS CREED, MY RIFLE AND MYSELF ARE THE DEFENDERS OF
      MY COUNRTY, WE ARE THE MASTERS OF OUR ENEMY, WE ARE THE SAVIORS OF MY LIFE. SO BE IT, UNTILL THERE IS NO ENEMY BUT
      PEACE."
